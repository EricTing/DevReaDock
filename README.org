** Distances profiling and Translating to tokens
1. ./src/eda.py
2. distribution of the ligand sizes in Angstrom
   /ddnB/work/jaydy/working/pdbbind/lig_sizes_hist.tiff
3. 10% quantile of distances is 13.08 Angstrom
4. distribution of the residue-atom distances
   /ddnB/work/jaydy/working/pdbbind/all_dists_hist.tiff
5. *Use an unique ligand size for translating*

** Accuracy v.s. Binning size
1. ./src/eda.py
2. Accuracy was measured on the test set
| binning  size | accuracy |
|---------------+----------|
|           7.0 |     2.41 |
|           6.0 |     2.34 |
|           5.0 |     2.31 |
|           4.0 |     2.38 |
|           3.0 |     2.65 |
